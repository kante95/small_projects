#The Project
A work in progress for creating an class measure that would ease the workload in the Course "Laboratory 3" of electronics. The aim of this class is to automate the calculations for the uncertainty of a measure.
#Credits
Most of the code is written by me, but the function "error_propagation" was mostly an idea of Kante95.
