In this small project I try to demostrate with a simulation how the entropy influences a system. In particular I want to show that the entropy of a system, with many small disks, except for two big ones, will cause the two big disks to stay close to each other. That is because with the two disks touching each other the number of configuration available for the small disks is maximized.
